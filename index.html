    HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language and is the standard markup language for creating Web pages. It consists of a series of elements that make up the structure of a Web page.
    The purpose of a web browser is to read HTML documents and display them correctly. It will not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document
    <p>An HTML element is everything from the start tag to some content to the end tag which tells the browser how to display the content by labeling pieces of content such as "this is a heading", this is a paragraph", etc/</p>
    <h1>The h1 element defines a large heading</h1>
    <p>The p element defines a paragraph</p>
    
</body>
