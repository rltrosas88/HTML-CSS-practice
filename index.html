    <h1>HTML stands for Hyper Text Markup Language.</h1>
    <p>HTML is the standard markup language for creating Web pages</p>
    <p>HTML describes the structure of a Web page</p>
    <p>HTML consists of a series of elements</p>
    <p>HTML elements tell the browser how to display the content</p>
    <p>HTML elements label pieces of content such as "this is a heading", "this is a paragraph", "this is a ling", etc</p>
    <p>The !Doctype html declaration defines that this document is an HTML5 document</p>
    <p>The html element is the root element of an HTML page</p>
    <p>The head element contains meta information about the HTML page</p>
    <p>The title element specifies a title for the HTML page (which is shown in the browser's title bar or in the page's tab)</p>
    <p>The body element defines the document's body, and is a container for all the visible contents, such as headings, paragraphs, images, hyperlinks, tables, lists, etc.</p>
    <h1>The h1 element defines a large heading</h1>
    <p>The p element defines a paragraph</p>
    <p>An HTML element is everything from the start tag to some content to the end tag.</p>
    <p>The purpose of a web browser is to read HTML documents and display them correctly. It will not display the HTML tags, but uses them to determine how to display the document</p>
